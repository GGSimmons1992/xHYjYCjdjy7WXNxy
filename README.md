# Voice Cloning and Fake Audio Detection
The goal of this project is to create 2 models, one is for Voice Cloning (VC), and the other is for Fake Audio Detection (FAD). The once the VC and the FAD are trained, the goal is to get the VC to generate a voice that will fool the FAD into believing the voice is real and not cloned
